    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Serves 10, from Ina Garten's <em>The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook</em>.</p>
    <p>This recipe is a vegetarian side that is <strong>cheesy, kid-friendly comfort food </strong>at its finest.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul><li>2 fennel bulbs, stalks removed</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced crosswise</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons good olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled (4 large potatoes)</li>
        <li>2 cups plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream, divided</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups grated Gruyère cheese, divided (½ pound)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper</li></ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter a 10 x 15 x 2-inch (10 cup) baking dish.</li>
            <li>Cut the bulbs in half lengthwise and slice them crosswise, making approximately 4 cups of sliced fennel. Put the olive oil and butter in a medium (10-inch) sauté pan and sauté the fennel and onions together over medium-low heat for 10 minutes, until tender.</li>
            <li>Thinly slice the potatoes by hand or with a mandoline. Place them in a large bowl with the 2 cups of cream, 2 cups of Gruyère, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper. Add the fennel and onion mixture and mix well.</li>
            <li>Pour the potato mixture into the prepared baking dish. Press down lightly to smooth the top. Combine the remaining 2 tablespoons of cream and ½ cup of Gruyère and sprinkle evenly on the top.  Bake for between 1 and 1¼ hours, until the potatoes are very tender and the top is browned and bubbly.  Allow to cool for 10 minutes and serve hot.</li></ol>
