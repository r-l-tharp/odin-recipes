    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Makes 2 loaves, from Ina Garten's <em>Cook Like a Pro</em>.</p>
        <p>This triple-chocolate cake is perfect for <strong>make-ahead holiday entertaining</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>    
    <ul><li>16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 cups plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>5 ounces bittersweet chocolate, such as Lindt, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder, such as Pernigotti</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon instant coffee granules, such as Nescafé</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup roughly chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup dark brown sugar, lightly packed</li>
        <li>3 extra-large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li></ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease two (8½ by 4½ by 2½-inch) loaf pans, line the bottoms with parchment paper, then grease and flour the pans.</li>
        <li>Pour the boiling water into a 2-cup glass measuring cup, add the bitter-sweet chocolate, cocoa powder, and coffee granules, and stir until the chocolate melts. Set aside to cool for at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, sift together the 2 cups flour, the baking powder, and salt and set aside. In another bowl, combine the walnuts, chocolate chips, and the 2 tablespoons flour and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together on medium speed for 2 minutes. With the mixer on low, add the eggs, one at a time, and then the vanilla, scraping down the bowl with a rubber spatula. Alternately in thirds, add the flour mixture and the chocolate mixture, beginning and ending with the flour. Fold in the nut mixture with a rubber spatula.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter equally between the prepared pans, smooth the tops, and bake for 45 to 55 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. (Test in a few places because you might hit a warm chocolate chip.) Cool in the pans for 30 minutes, turn out on a cooling rack, rounded side up, and allow to cool to room temperature.</li></ol>
